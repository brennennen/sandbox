# Processor Control Instructions
These instructions (see table 2-16) allow programs to control various CPU functions. One group of instructions updates flags, and another group is used primarily for synchronizing the 8086 and 8088 with external events. A final instruction causes the CPU to do nothing. Except for the flag operations, none of the process control instructions affect the flags.
