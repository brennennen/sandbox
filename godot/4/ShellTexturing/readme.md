# Shell Texturing Prototype

## Technique
### High Level
* Create a series of shells around an object. So if you have a sphere
* For a single blade of grass or strand of hair
	* Spawn a series of small 1 sided plane mesh instances with some space between them from the surface of the mesh outward.
* Repeat this with noise patterns impacting size, color, various other attributes across the entire mesh surface.
TODO: wind? noise? movement?
