## Critiques
Feels very "math academic" compared to advent of code or leetcode style questions, which are at least more "algorithm" focused. Lots of problems don't even require programming, just pen and paper and remembering esoteric advanced math topics. The problem pool feels more "academic" (math for the sake of math) vs "engineering" (practical/real world use case maths) focused.

## Notes:
 * Site guidelines only allow posting solutions to first 100 in the problem set.
